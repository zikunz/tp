Are you a home-based business owner tired of using a pen and paper to keep track of your inventory? Do you have limited
budget to invest in a new system to manage your business? Fret not, easyLog, our cross-platform<sup>1
</sup> logistics management application will get you covered! It is the application to boost your productivity when it
comes to managing your items and orders and best of all, it is free! Primarily, the current version of easyLog allows
you to add new items and orders before updating, viewing and finding existing items and orders easily. easyLog also allows
you to remove a specific item and order and clear all existing items and orders in the inventory at ease. You can
also generate receipts for your customers and find out your best-selling product(s)<sup>2</sup>.

easyLog is highly optimized for home-based business owners like you via a carefully designed Command Line Interface
(CLI); this means that you will run the application by typing commands into a command terminal<sup>3
</sup>. If you type fast, easyLog can get logistics management tasks done more efficiently than traditional Graphical
User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the applications through visuals such
as buttons, at the expense of lower precision and slower speed as compared to CLI.

If this sounds great to you, we encourage you to visit [Quick start](#1-quick-start) to start learning how to manage
your inventory using easyLog. This guide also gives you a step-by-step instruction to use various features easyLog has
to offer and we have prepared [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#3-faq) and a concise table of
[Command Summary](#4-command-summary) for you. We invite you to explore easyLog.

1. Currently supports Windows, macOS and Linux machines which have Java 11 installed. <br>
2. The best-selling item refers to the item which has the most number of sales. That is, the item is added to
   orders for the most number of times. There can be multiple items which are the most popular. This happens when more than
   one item have the most number of sales.
3. Depending on which operating system you are using, how to open the command terminal application to operate easyLog
   differs. Please refer to [Quick start](#1-quick-start) for more information. <br>

## 1. Quick start

Setting up easyLog is made really easy. It does not even require an installation, and a few simple 
steps listed below will be good to go.

1. Ensure your device has Java 11 installed.

> To check if you have Java 11 installed, simply type `java --version` in the command terminal of your operating system.
> <br>
> For Windows users, you can type `cmd` in the Windows search box before pressing Enter to open the Command Prompt. <br>
> For macOS users, you can press Command and Space to launch Spotlight and type `Terminal` before pressing Enter. <br>
> For Ubuntu users, you can press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a terminal window.

2. Download the latest easyLog.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/releases/v2.1).
3. Put the downloaded jar file in an empty folder in which easyLog is allowed to create files
   (i.e., do not use a write-protected folder).
4. In the same command terminal, run the command `java -jar easyLog.jar`.
5. The app should load and the welcome page is as shown below:

![Initiation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60378963/114325708-1669cf00-9b64-11eb-86b8-2a8ef6b22bee.jpg)

## 2. Features

Section 2 will explain the features available in easyLog.

###### Notes about the command format:

* Any word surrounded by `<>` is a parameter to be entered by the user (e.g., in `items add <item_name>`, `item_name` is
  a parameter, and a valid command can be `items add mp3`).

* Any leading and trailing whitespaces will be neglected. This means, for instance, `<spaces> help <spaces>` will trigger
  [2.1 viewing help: `help`](#21-viewing-help-help).

* In the user guide, you will come across 📄 which can refer to a tip or warning.

1. Input `help` command.
2. Press Enter.
3. All available commands will then be shown.

### 2.4. Storage

Section 2.4 will explain storage related features.

#### 2.4.1. Load, create and save data

While initializing easyLog, it automatically looks for an available save file to load so that you can continue your
progress from the previous exit. If there are no save file available to load, easyLog will automatically create a save
file for you and save your data and information when exiting the app. The save file will be named as `easyLog.txt` and 
will be located in the same folder/directory as the easyLog app.

The save file can be copied to another device and placed in the same folder/directory that contains the easyLog app. Do 
take note that only one `easyLog.txt` should be in the directory or there would be an error. This transfer of save file 
allows you to work on multiple devices if you choose to do so.

It is not recommended that you manipulate/edit the data in `easyLog.txt`. However, if you are an expert user and confident,
do feel free to manipulate the data in `easyLog.txt` manually if it enhances your workflow.

Note:

#### 2.4.2. Generate receipts

When [`orders done`](#238-update-the-status-of-an-order-orders-done) feature is executed, a receipt will be 
automatically generated that contains the order details that was deleted. The generated receipts can be found in the 
same directory as the location of the easyLog app inside a `Receipts` folder. The receipts generated will be in a `.txt` 
format. This allows the list of orders while using the app to be kept clean with only the orders that are not done for
easier viewing. Also, the generated receipts allows you to keep track of your revenue or to handle your taxes.
Furthermore, receipts are numbered to show you how many orders you have fulfilled.

Note:

> 📄 The receipts generated can only be seen in the directory where you start the app from when you 
> [exit](#25-exit-the-program-exit) the app.

## 3. FAQ

**Q1**: easyLog keeps showing a "bad init" error message despite the fact that I first use it.
> Please check and ensure that easyLog has write permissions in the folder. Do not use a write-protected folder.

**Q2**: Do I lose all my data after exiting easyLog?
> No, all relevant records are saved upon `exit` command.

**Q3**: I do not seem to be able to add an item. Why is this so?

> There could be many possibilities which can result in you not being able to add an item. We advise you to follow
> the below steps when intending to add an item. <br/>
>
> Please note that you need to specify the description of the item. For instance, you can do this
> by typing `items add Competitive Programming 4`. <br/>
>
> After that, input the **price per item** *(unit price)* and item stock. Please note that the unit price is either zero (free item) or
> a positive number smaller or equal to 1,000,000,000 while item stock is a positive number smaller or equal to 1000000000.
> For example, you can enter `20 100`. <br/>

**Q4**: I do not seem to be able to add an order. Why is this so?

> There could be many possibilities which can result in you not being able to add an order. We advise you to follow
> the below steps when intending to add an order. <br/>
>
> Please note that you need to specify a customer's name as he or she is the one whom the order of interest will be
> sent to. For instance, you can do this by typing `orders add Alice`. <br/>
>
> After that, input the item number found in the item list (if unsure, simply type `items list` to check) and the quantity.
> For example, you could type `1 2`.

**Q5**: I am scared that I input any command which I do not intend to execute. Is there a way to revert changes in the
system?

> If you input any invalid command (e.g., an unrecognized command or a clearing command for the item list when the list
> is already empty), it will not be executed. <br/>
>
> In the event that you accidentally add an item or order, you can always undo it by deleting the item or order.
> Likewise, you can add an item or order back if you delete it mistakenly. For now, easyLog does not have a command
> to revert any changes. We may consider adding it in the upcoming version. <br/>
