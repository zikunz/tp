### Features implemented

1. Items Add feature.
2. Items Update feature. 
3. Items stats feature.   
4. Orders Delete feature.

### Enhancements implemented

1. Items Update feature: <br>
   Ensured easyLog will keep asking users to input the item index to be updated, the item field as well as
   the revised price or stock while executing `items update` command when encountering an error instead of exiting the 
   command causing confusion.
2. Items Stats feature: <br>
   Ensured the number of sales of relevant items will decrease correspondingly when executing `orders delete`
   command to delete an order.
3. Orders delete feature: <br>
   Extracted a method to combine the number of sales will decrease, and the items will be added 
   back to item list when deleting an order,such another teammate can call this method when he implemented another feature to
   improve code re-usability.
4. Exceptions for features: <br>
   Ensured exception can be caught correctly and easyLog will show correct error messages.
5. JUnitTest: <br>
   Added some JUnitTest codes to do testing.
